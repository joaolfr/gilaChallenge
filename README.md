This project is a take home challenge for Gila Software Software Engineer position. It is built using modern web development tools and best practices to ensure code quality, performance, and maintainability.

For this project, I decided to go with Vite, because it's super fast, easy to set up, and makes the dev workflow faster with quick updates and builds. You'll spend less time waiting and more time coding.

I tried to focus on finishing this project most simply, as an alternative I created a second project ([Gila X Challenge](https://github.com/joaolfr/gilaXchallenge)) implementing new ideas and using new tools.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: Provides static typing to help catch errors early and improve code quality.
- **Vite**: Used as the compiler for React to enable fast development and optimized builds.
- **ESLint**: Configured to enforce consistent code style and improve readability.
- **Axios**: Used for making API requests in a simple and efficient manner.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/joaolfr/gilaChallenge
   cd gilaChallenge
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code.
- `public/`: Contains static assets.
- `.eslintrc.cjs`: ESLint configuration file.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file.
- `vite.config.ts`: Vite configuration file.
- `api/`: API configuration file using axios

## Additional Information

- **Code Quality**: ESLint is set up to ensure code quality and consistency across the project.
- **API Requests**: Axios is used for handling all API requests, providing a clean and simple way to interact with external services.
